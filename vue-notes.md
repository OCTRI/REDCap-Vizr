# Vue Notes

* Not really feasible to switch to Jest due to use of `<canvas>` element
* Do one of these:
  1. Introduce Webpack build setup from app generated with Vue CLI
  2. Or update existing Webpack setup to deal with `.vue` files (probably this)
* Implement components (convert tests as you go):
  1. Vizr app
  2. Instructions
  3. Chart
    * Question of how to handle data loading
  4. Stats table
  5. Chart form
