# Vizr External Module

Vizr was created by the Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute's (OCTRI)
Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) Application team at Oregon Health & Science University
(OHSU) with the aim to visualize data contained within a REDCap project.

This external module provides a way for project designers to create charts summarizing their data
in a time series fashion to provide additional insights about their project.

# Vizr Installation and Upgrades

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

# Vizr Permissions

By default, all users of a project with Vizr enabled may view charts.

For users that also need to create, edit, and delete charts you must give them **Project Design and Setup** rights. To do so follow these steps:

* Navigate, on a project with Vizr, to **User Rights**
* Select a user
* Click **Edit user privileges**
* Under **Highest level privileges** check **Project Design and Setup*
* Save
